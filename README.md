## Project Overview

This project was developed for the **[COM1025 Web and Database Systems](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2022-3/module/COM1025)** module (University of Surrey, Year 1, Semester 1). It is a full-stack web application designed to manage a University Sports Park, featuring a robust database backend, a dynamic PHP frontend, and an auxiliary Java component for auction management.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Awarded Grade:** 73% (First Class).
- **Full-Stack Implementation:** Built from scratch using raw PHP and SQL without frameworks to demonstrate core understanding of web technologies.
- **Complex Data Modeling:** Implemented an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model with advanced constraints.

---

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Database Architecture (MySQL)
The core of the system is a relational database designed to handle staff, members, sessions, and memberships with integrity.
- **Advanced Constraints:** Usage of `CHECK` constraints (e.g., ensuring `SHESH_STime < SHESH_ETime`).
- **Data Integrity:** `ENUM` types for gender and teaching levels to enforce consistency.
- **Relationships:** Complex foreign key mapping for "Gold" and "Silver" membership subclasses inheriting from a base `Membership` table.
- **Security:** Account/Staff separate tables to isolate authentication credentials.

### 2. Backend Logic (PHP)
The web application interface allows users and staff to interact with the database dynamically.
- **Raw PHP:** Demonstrates understanding of server-side scripting, session management, and database connectivity (`PDO`/`mysqli`).
- **Dynamic Content:** Pages adapt based on database state (e.g., displaying available gym sessions dynamically).
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system linking to the `Account` table.

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
An independent component demonstrating OOP principles.
- **Auctioneer System:** The `coursework_question1/Auctioneer.java` class models a car auction system.
- **Key Concepts:** Encapsulation, inheritance, and collection management (`HashMap` for tracking sold/unsold items).

## How to Run

### prerequisites
- **XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP** (or any environment with Apache & MySQL)
- **Java JDK** (for the Auctioneer component)

### Steps
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Open phpMyAdmin (or your preferred SQL client).
   - Import `db_setup.sql` to create the `University_Sports_Park` database and tables.
   - (Optional) Run queries from `sql_queries.sql` to test data retrieval.

2. **Web Application:**
   - Move the `website/` folder to your server's root directory (`htdocs` or `www`).
   - Configure `website/db_connect.php` if your MySQL credentials differ from default.
   - Navigate to `localhost/website/index.php` in your browser.

3. **Java Component:**
   - Navigate to `coursework_question1/`.
   - Compile and run:
     ```bash
     javac coursework_question1/Auctioneer.java
     ```
